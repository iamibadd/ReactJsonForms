## "ProAct is a Tool for Action-Oriented Process Mining: Turning Events to Actions"

*Action-oriented process mining* focuses on generating necessary management actions that enhance business processes' performance. These actions are derived by analyzing event data through process mining techniques. **ProAct** is a tool that supports action-oriented process mining.

ProAct is comprised of three main components:

* **ProAct: Monitoring Engine** - This part of ProAct works by creating constraint instances from user-provided event logs and constraint graphs.

* **ProAct: Action Engine** - This engine processes the constraint instances along with user-designed action graphs to generate action instances.

* **ProAct: Impact Analysis** - Finally, this component uses action instances and event logs supplied by the user to calculate the impact of the action instance.

With ProAct, you can effectively utilize action-oriented process mining to improve your business processes. Each component of the tool plays a critical role in the analysis process, ultimately providing you with data-driven actions to enhance your business performance.
